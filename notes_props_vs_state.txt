PROPS VS. STATE

props flow from parents to children, not the other way around

both props and state:
-are objects (this.props, this.state)
-can be used when rendering
-cause re-rendering when changed

BUT
-changes to PROPS are made from ABOVE, while changes to STATE happen within the component
-to reiterate: props CANNOT be changed by the component itself, but state can
    -so to change the props, you'll need to have a function at the highest level of the component. bind it properly and give it to a child component as a prop, then call it from the child. The change to the props then trickles down into the child component and gets stuff re-rendered.
