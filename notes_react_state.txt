How does component state fit in?

Let's think about counter-example.js
How would we do that in React w/ component state?

Step 1: Set up default state object (w/ default values)

{
    count: 0
}

2. Render component with default state values
then call render() and the app shows up. the state is raided to fill the app with data

say you click the +1 button
handleAddOne(){
    //add 1 to count
}

so now the state has changed.

3. Change state based on event

4. Re-render the app with the new state values
*the React component API sees this change and updates the app automatically

5. Start again at 3

let's do away with manually rerendering stuff!
